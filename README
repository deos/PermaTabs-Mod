Turn tabs of your choice into permanent tabs. PermaTabs can't be closed accidentally no matter 
what you click (even actions like "Close other tabs" will not affect them) and will stick around 
between sessions.

Ideal for keeping URLs you use often, always one tab away. 
Also, ideal for picking up specific articles where you left off during a previous session.

From first installation PermaTabs includes three random sample tabs (from a built in list) 
to get you started. Maybe you'll discover a useful site you never knew about?

Adding or removing a permatab is simple - right click a site's tab, and check/uncheck "Permanent Tab".

By right click a permanent tab there is a new context menu entry named "Permatab Home" which leads 
the tab back to the site original set as permatab.
